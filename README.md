# Welcome to Rewardz
**Rewardz** - Empowers content creators to empower learners.

## Preamble 

**COVID** has changed learning forever. There is a paradigm shift in the way people learnt pre and post COVID, there is high growth and adoption in Education Technology. We are experiencing an unplanned and rapid migration to online learning. A huge number of people started joining online courses to **reskill** and **upskill**.

It is clear that this pandemic has utterly disrupted the way we learn. It had both positive and negative impacts. There was a terrible disconnect between the enrollment rate and completion rate which questioned the impact of online learning.

## Problem Statement

Learner's drop out rate is up by **67 %** with most of them leaving due to a lack of Motivation and engaging content. We need to fix this problem by focusing on ways to **Motivate and influence** the users ,Personalise and **Reward** their learning journey.

Based on our primary and secondary research, we found the following pain points in the traditional online learning platforms.

For Learners :
Lack Completion rate and engagement
Lack motivation

For Content Creators :
Inability to influence learners behavior
Delayed payments

Platform :
Expensive to onboard new learners and attract new content creators

## Inspiration

The inspiration for our idea came from the following pointers.

* Emphasize on Information, skill, habit, motivation and environment
* UN Sustainability Goal 4 (quality education) and 10 (Reduce inequality)
* Incentivizing learners and content creators
* Enable content creator to influence learners behavior (Behavioral economics)

## Our solution
We built a Dapp that instantly rewards the learner as well the content creator.
The content creator influences and incentivizes the learner by offering a reward
when they achieve a milestone.
